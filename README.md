### What is the difference between OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and Functual Programming?
**Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “objects”, which are instances of a class. These objects contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that describe their characteristics and actions.

**Function Programming (FP)** is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “functions” that take inputs and produce outputs. These functions are pure, meaning they don’t have side-effects, and are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed around as arguments or returned as results.
